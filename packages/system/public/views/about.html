          <h3>MY STORY</h3>
          <p>
            Growing up, I was extremely shy and introverted, I was always negative, lazy and I had list of friends that would agree in a heart beat, in turn I started suffering from depression and anxiety and I did not even know it. As you can imagine some of those habits carried over into college, and I continued to try to manage them as much as possible. It got so bad I felt that their was no way out of the deep dark cloud that surrounded me for years. Don't believe me? See why I am <a href="">no longer employable</a>, and how I <a href="http://vanquishacne.com/eat-my-black-heart-out/">ate my black heart out</a> and most importantly find out how I managed to <a href="http://codewithintent.com/dealing-with-life/">deal</a> with those issues. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><h4>November 1, 2014 everything changed!</h4></b>I looked myself in the mirror with a critical eye overweight, zits all over my face, broke with no money, overworked and nothing to show for it! I finally had enough. I reached the point of an "emotional threshold" and finally made a decision that would shape my life forever.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="small center" style="padding: 10px 10px;font-size: 21px;">
            "I will <b>NEVER</b> settle for less than I can be, do, give, or create."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I knew that I was so much more than what I was demonstrating in life. I knew I had potential, and had finally decided to tap into it once an for all.
            With this in mind everything started turning around for me, I finally figured out what I am suppose to do, and the means of doing so. I created an awesome software <a href="http://codewithintent.com/mean-io-tutorial-building-goals-application-from-scratch-part-1/">application</a> that let's you track your personal goals, stop relying on the university to provide me with education and started taking action on my own  <a href="http://codewithintent.com/rimas-rethink-radio-with-machine-learning/">self education</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I quickly came to the conclusion that the only way to change myself would be to face my biggest fears that I have, and this is why this site was born.
